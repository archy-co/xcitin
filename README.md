## Destination
This module designed to find location where film's recordings took place for specified year. First of all, all films are filtered by year, then some further filtrations take place, e.g. unvalid location, roughly specified countries groups checks and filters. If films list size is to long and location calculation with geopy would take way too long, films are randomly chosen (usually this happens for USA because there are too many films recorded each year and state filtering is not implemented)

## Conclusions
This module is capable of generating places, where film's recordings took place. This idea may be further developped with more accurate data about locations and precalculated coordinates to optimize module execution time

## Example
Example run for year **2004** and user location **[37.09024, -95.712891]** (Note, that this module may use randomized functions, so your output may slightly vary)
